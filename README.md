# MediaOrganizer

A comprehensive PowerShell utility for organizing and processing local photos and videos with intelligent date extraction, GPU-accelerated video conversion, and safe rollback capabilities.

**Author:** Ryan Zeffiretti  
**Version:** 1.1.1 (Latest Release)  
**License:** MIT

## Why MediaOrganizer?

I created this script to solve the common problem of disorganized media files. Modern devices create files with inconsistent naming patterns, making it difficult to sort and organize photos and videos chronologically. MediaOrganizer standardizes filenames, extracts accurate timestamps from multiple sources, and provides efficient video conversion with hardware acceleration.

**Key Problems Solved:**

- **Inconsistent naming:** Different devices use various date formats (DJI_20231201_143022, IMG_20231201_143022, etc.)
- **Missing timestamps:** Some files lack proper EXIF data or have corrupted metadata
- **Large file sizes:** Videos often need compression for storage efficiency
- **No undo capability:** Manual renaming is risky without backup mechanisms

## Features

### Video Rename

- **Intelligent date extraction** from multiple sources with priority-based selection
- **Collision-safe renaming** with automatic suffix generation
- **Date sources (priority order):** Filename patterns ‚Üí EXIF/FFprobe/MediaInfo ‚Üí File system ‚Üí Folder year
- **Smart defaults:** Date-only matches default to `00:00:00` for consistency
- **Optional metadata updates:** Update embedded EXIF data and file system timestamps
- **Complete audit trail:** Rollback maps written to `maps/VideosRenameMap.csv`

### Video Convert (GPU‚ÜíCPU)

- **Multi-GPU support:** Auto-detects and prioritizes NVIDIA (NVENC) ‚Üí Intel (QSV) ‚Üí AMD (AMF) ‚Üí CPU (libx265)
- **Quality presets:**
  - `default` (balanced auto-bitrate with smart calculation)
  - `gpu-hq` (higher-quality GPU compression)
  - `smaller` (maximum compression, slower encoding)
  - `faster` (faster encoding, larger files)
  - `lossless` (no compression, original quality)
- **Smart bitrate calculation:** Automatically adjusts based on resolution (‚â§720p 50%, ‚â§1080p 60%, ‚â§1440p 65%, else 70%)
- **Advanced options:** Skip HEVC files, choose container (mp4/mkv), parallel processing (1-8 jobs), preserve timestamps
- **Parallel encoding:** Configurable job count for multi-core systems
- **Automatic cleanup:** Deletes source after successful conversion (backup preserved)
- **Detailed reporting:** Shows before/after sizes and space savings
- **Comprehensive logging:** All operations logged to `logs/Convert-Videos.log`

### Photo Rename

- **Wide format support:** jpg/jpeg/png/heic/bmp/tiff
- **Multi-source date extraction:** filename patterns ‚Üí EXIF (exiftool) ‚Üí file system ‚Üí folder year
- **Optional EXIF updates:** Update DateTimeOriginal/CreateDate/ModifyDate to chosen date
- **Format conversion:** Optional conversion of non-JPEG images to JPEG (ImageMagick)
- **Timestamp preservation:** Maintains original file timestamps after rename
- **Rollback capability:** Complete undo via `maps/PicturesRenameMap.csv`

### Rollback Operations

- **Safe undo system:** Uses CSV maps for reliable rollback operations
- **Video rollback:** Restores original filenames using `maps/VideosRenameMap.csv`
- **Photo rollback:** Restores original filenames using `maps/PicturesRenameMap.csv`
- **Dry-run support:** Preview changes before applying
- **Comprehensive logging:** All rollback operations logged for audit trail

## Requirements

- **Windows PowerShell 5.1** or **PowerShell 7+**
- **External tools** (auto-detected with helpful download links):
  - `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` (required for video conversion) ‚Äî [Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - `exiftool` (optional: enhanced metadata support) ‚Äî [Download](https://exiftool.org/)
  - `MediaInfo` (optional: additional metadata extraction) ‚Äî [Download](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)
  - `ImageMagick` `magick` (optional: photo format conversion) ‚Äî [Download](https://imagemagick.org/)

**Installation:** Place these EXEs in a local `tools/` folder next to the script or add them to PATH. The app provides clear status messages for missing tools.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Run the PowerShell Script

1. Download the source (Code ‚Üí Download ZIP) or from Releases
2. Extract to a folder of your choice
3. Place required tools in `tools/` or ensure they‚Äôre on PATH
4. Run:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\MediaOrganizer.ps1
```

### Option 2: Standalone EXE (Recommended)

Download the latest release EXE from the [Releases](https://github.com/Zeffer83/media-organizer/releases) page.

1. Extract to a folder
2. Place required tools in the `tools/` subfolder
3. Run `MediaOrganizer.exe`

## Menu Overview

```
MediaOrganizer v1.1.1
Author: Ryan Zeffiretti
------------------------------------------------------------
Organize and process your media:
 ‚Ä¢ Rename: Standardize filenames to yyyy-MM-dd_HHmmss with safe collisions.
   Sources for date (priority): Name, Exif/FFprobe/MediaInfo/Meta, File System, Folder year.
   For date-only matches the time defaults to 00:00:00.
 ‚Ä¢ Convert: Try GPU HEVC (NVENC/QSV/AMF) first, fallback to CPU x265; preserve timestamps if selected.
   Balanced preset auto-sets bitrate from source (‚â§720p:50%, ‚â§1080p:60%, ‚â§1440p:65%, else:70%, floored at 300k).
   GPU HQ improves GPU quality (slower). CPU x265 is slowest but highest efficiency/quality.

1) Rename videos
   - Dry-run by default. Logs: logs/RenameVideos.log, map: maps/VideosRenameMap.csv
   - Optional: update embedded metadata and/or file system times.
   - Supported: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .wmv, .flv, .webm, .mpg, .mts
2) Convert videos (GPU‚ÜíCPU)
   - Logs: Convert-Videos.log. Backup under <source>/backup (skipped on scan).
   - Options: skip HEVC, choose container (mp4/mkv), parallel jobs.
   - Deletes source after successful encode (backup kept). Summary shows size saved.
3) Rename photos (.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.heic/.bmp/.tiff)
   - Dry-run by default. Preserves file timestamps after rename.
   - Uses filename patterns, EXIF (exiftool), and file system dates; optional EXIF date update.
   - Optional: convert non-JPEG to JPEG (requires ImageMagick `magick`).
   - Logs: PhotoRename.log, warnings (chosen source): PhotoWarnings.log, map: PicturesRenameMap.csv
4) Roll back last video rename
   - Uses maps/VideosRenameMap.csv to restore original filenames (dry-run by default).
5) Roll back last photo rename
   - Uses maps/PicturesRenameMap.csv to restore original filenames (dry-run by default).
0) Exit
Select option:
```
